I am a Ph.D student at [Nexa Center for Internet and Society](https://nexa.polito.it/), a research center of the [Department of Control and Computer Engineering](https://www.dauin.polito.it/it/) of the [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).

I am working with Professors [Juan Carlos De Martin](https://demartin.polito.it/) and [Antonio Vetr√≤](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=antonio.vetro).

I study data fairness in the field of Responsible AI. My research focuses on exploring data documentation, data quality and data ethics. My overarching goal    is to investigate and address algorithmic discriminations.
