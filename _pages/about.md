I am a Ph.D student at Nexa Center for Internet and Society, at Department of Control and Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.

I am working with Juan Carlos De Martin and Antonio Vetr√≤.

I study data fairness in the field of Responsible AI. My research focuses on exploring data documentation, data quality and data ethics. My overarching goal    is to investigate and address algorithmic discriminations.
