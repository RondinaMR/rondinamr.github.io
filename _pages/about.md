I am a Ph.D student at [Nexa Center for Internet and Society](https://nexa.polito.it/), a research center of the [Department of Control and Computer Engineering](https://www.dauin.polito.it/it/) of the [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).

I am working with Professors [Juan Carlos De Martin](https://demartin.polito.it/) and [Antonio Vetrò](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=antonio.vetro).

My research focuses on data fairness in the field of Responsible AI / AI Safety, with the overarching goal of investigating and addressing algorithmic discrimination in real-world systems. I study how data quality, data documentation and data ethics intersect to enable or prevent unfair outcomes in AI applications.

I approach these challenges through empirical methods, conducting algorithmic audits and black-box testing of deployed systems across various domains, from automated decision-making systems to large language models. My work combines quantitative analysis of bias and fairness with the development of practical frameworks for measuring, documenting and improving datasets.

A central thread in my research is understanding how inadequate data practices (from poor documentation to imbalanced representation) can lead to discriminatory outcomes, particularly against marginalized and vulnerable groups. I investigate these issues both by testing existing systems and by developing tools that help practitioners build more accountable and equitable data-driven software.
