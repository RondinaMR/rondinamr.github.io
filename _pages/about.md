I am a Ph.D student at [Nexa Center for Internet and Society](https://nexa.polito.it/), a research center of the [Department of Control and Computer Engineering](https://www.dauin.polito.it/it/) of the [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).

I am working with Professors [Juan Carlos De Martin](https://demartin.polito.it/) and [Antonio VetrÃ²](https://avetro.polito.it/).

I study data fairness in the field of Responsible AI. My research focuses on exploring data documentation, data quality and data ethics. My overarching goal    is to investigate and address algorithmic discriminations.

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª I'm currently a [guest researcher](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en/portrait/p/marco-rondina/) at the [Data, Algorithmic Systems and Ethics](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en/research/digital-technologies-in-society/data-algorithmic-systems-and-ethics/) Research Group at the [Weizenbaum Institute](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en/) (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin).
